The CC430 is a 16 bit microcontroller and now the shift is made to a 32 bit cortex M3 from Silicon Labs. The development board that we are using is the Giant Gecko STK-3700. The CC430 is an SoC that contains a microcontroller and radio chip. The Giant Gecko is only a microcontroller and therefore we had to develop a radio module which can be plugged-in the expansion port of the Gecko starter kit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a long time developing on the CC430, we are switching to a more powerful microcontroller.

The Giant Gecko is only a microcontroller and therefore we had to develop a radio module which can be plugged-in the expansion port of the Gecko starter kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the expertise that is build up around CC1101, the choice is made to develop first a CC1101 RF module. Later on, different RF chips will be included in the platform, but now we are focusing on the CC1101 and the Giant Gecko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gaint Gecko is a development board that contains onboard programmer from Segger. There are few sensors on board that can be easily used with the DASH7 open software stack. There are four sensors: temperature, light sensor, metal detection and capacitive touch sensor. An LCD make it possible to show the sensor data on the screen, but also other data as received signal strength. A very nice feature that silicon lab provides is the Simplicity Studio software package. It not only contains a prepared IDE based on Eclipse, but also low-power measurement software to measure the impact of different parts of the code on the energy consumption.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other important features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two userbuttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two LEDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CR2032 connector, other solution is to power the board with a USB connector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All pins are accessible with a jumper cable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USB on-the-go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RF module is based on the basic schematic from the TI CC1101 development kit. Only this board provide a connector that smoothly fits on the Gaint Gecko. Currently  two frequencies are supported, 433MHz and 868 MHz. 
The &lt;a href="https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/lowpower/Pages/efm32gg-stk3700.aspx"&gt;Giant Gecko STK-3700&lt;/a&gt; is available on different online electronic component shops. Such as Farnell, Mouser, Digikey, etc.
More information about this module and the schema itself is available on our &lt;a href="http://mosaic-lopow.github.io/dash7-ap-open-source-stack/doxygen/md_hardware.html"&gt;supported hardware page&lt;/a&gt; If you have questions about the RF module you can contact use through mailing list or Github.&lt;/p&gt;
