# Welcome

Sub-IoT is an open source implementation of a combination of Sub GHz technologies. The implementation exists of the [DASH7 Alliance](http://www.dash7-alliance.org) protocol and the [LoRaWAN specification](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan/) for ultra low power wireless sensor communication. The aim of the project is to provide an implementation of the sub-GHz stacks running consecutively which allows for fast development and prototyping. This implementation focusses on completeness, correctness, ease of use and understanding. Performance and code size are less important aspects. For clarity a clear separation between the ISO layers is maintained in the code.
